# Beebots/Taxify
This module gets realtime tax rates from Taxify.
That's all it does at this point. It does not push commited orders to Taxify.


## Installation
```
composer require "beebots/magento2-taxify"
```

## Thanks
Thanks to [rk/taxify](https://github.com/rk/taxify) for providing the API layer this module uses.
